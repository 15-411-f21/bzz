Each dying cricket that is not removed becomes a source of a chemical compound called ammonia, to which crickets are extremely sensitive. The release of this gas is one of the reason why people complain crickets stink. The more ammonia, the more healthy crickets will perish.

Now go ahead and remove the dead crickets. You caused enough damage already you ****!
