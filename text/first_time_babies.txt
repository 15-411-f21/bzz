Oh wow! Look at them! Some of the eggs hatched!

The babies are called nymphs. Nymphs look like small versions of adult crickets with a few differences. They are not as developed so initially do not have wings and females do not have ovipositors. These young crickets often become prey for larger crickets and other insects.
